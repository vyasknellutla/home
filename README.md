# Home Directory

This repository is a personal preference configuration on how a home directory should be across any Operating System. As a result it makes no attempts to accomodate for alternate preferences/workflows.

For a customizable home directory setup, I encourage you to visit https://github.com/vyasknellutla/.dotfiles as a base (or in my case a submodule) for organizing and configuring a home directory
